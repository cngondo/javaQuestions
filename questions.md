1. Develop a Java program that reads a temperature value in Celsius degrees from the keyboard and
  transforms it to Fahrenheit degrees. The program must print the two values in the form:
   `` X Celsius degrees are Y Fahrenheit degrees.``

   NOTE: `` (F-32)/9 = C/5 `` where F is Farenheit and C is Celsius.

2. Write a program that you input your name and it welcomes you to Moringa School i.e when you input ``John`` the output should be:
   `` John, Welcome to Moringa School ``

3. Write a program that takes in an integer number as seconds and transforms it into an expression in hours minutes and seconds i.e `` 3680`` seconds should give `` 1 hour, 1 minute and 20 seconds``

4. Create a program with two classes i.e:
  - Shapes: that calculates the area of shapes i.e circle, triangle, rectangle.
  This class should have the different methods with the respective parameters.
  - Area: that contains the main method and the method calls with actual values and outputs the different areas.
  The program should output the different areas of the shapes.
  The fx:
      - Area of a triangle: 0.5 * base * height
      - Area of a circle: PI * radius * radius where PI = 3.142
      - Area of a rectangle: length * width

5. Write a program that prints the next 10 leap years from 2016

6. Write a program that prints numbers from 1 - 100 using the following conditions:
      - If the number is divisible by three, let it print `` Fizz`` instead of the number
      - If the number is divisible by five, let it print `` Buzz`` instead of the number
      - If the number is divisible by both three and five, let it print `` Fizz Buzz`` instead of the number

7. Write a program that sums up multiples of 3 and 5 below 1000.
